## Travel recommendation

**Don't even think about it.** The country has a long way to go before it's
recovered enough to open to tourism. The curfew that's in place would make
things very difficult on tourists.

## Latest news

According to the U.S. Embassy in Algeria the country remains in fairly strict
lockdow including a 8pm to 5am curfew. There doesn't appear to be a target date
for reopening their economy to tourism.
