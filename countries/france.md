## Travel recommendations

**Wait and see.** Borders are supposed to be opening to overseas tourism as of
July 1 but [there is likely to be a number of
caveats](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/world/europe/coronavirus-EU-American-travel-ban.html)
to who is and isn't allowed to enter the country. Before making travel
decisions, wait until the guidelines are presented.
